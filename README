ActsAsRole
==========

Roles based permissions. The created permissions are based on the convention of routing resources.  You can have fine grained control on specific 
methods.  Also, multiple roles given to one person.  

One other nice feature is the ability to modify the view.  While I don't like adding a bunch of logic to my views, this pretty clean.



Example
=======

has_access?(users_path)
