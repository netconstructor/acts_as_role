ActsAsRole
==========

Roles based permissions. The created permissions are based on the convention of routing resources.  You can have fine
 grained control on specific methods.  Also, multiple roles given to one person.  

One other nice feature is the ability to modify the view.  While I don't like adding a bunch of logic to my views, 
this is pretty clean.



Example
=======

has_access?(users_path)
 or 
has_access?(:controller => 'users', :action => 'index')
